# KiCAD schematics

KiCAD schematics for the adapter.

The [compact pcb](compact) (suggested) uses a detachable ribbon cable to
connect to to the computer and features an optional jumper to switch the
adapter to C64 mode.

The [full adapter](full) has an ICSP header for programming the PIC
in-circuit, and through-hole D-sub connectors for both the computer and
controller side of the adapter.  Using an extension cable or soldering a
joystick cable pigtail directly to the computer side of the adapter is
recommended; the adapter will not fit directly in most joystick ports.

The [tiny pcb](tiny) (untested; not recommended) has edge connectors for
solder cup D-sub connectors and uses a simple solder bridge jumper to
convert it to C64 mode.
