# KiCAD schematics

KiCAD schematics for the adapter.

The [full adapter](full) has an ICSP header for programming the PIC, a three-pin
header for the C64/programming mode jumper, and through-hole D-sub connectors.

The [compact pcb](compact) removes the ICSP header and replaces the
computer side D-sub connector with an IDC header.  It has a two-pin
header for the C64 mode jumper.

The [tiny pcb](tiny) has edge connectors for solder cup D-sub connectors
and uses a simple solder bridge jumper for C64 mode.
